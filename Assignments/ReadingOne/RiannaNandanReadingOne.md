Article: Intellectual Property in the Age of Digital Reproduction

  Intellectual property in the art world is becoming an increasingly touchy subject. Corporations are stealing more and more art from small-time artists, who are unable to fully legally defend themselves from those who would profit off their works. The lines of who owns what are especially unclear when the things being “owned” are not tangible - much like intellectual property, digital property exists outside of our physical world. 
  
  This is becoming increasingly exploitable by companies as well - take, for example, Google’s new gaming system Stadia, a device that streams games directly from Google’s servers and machines instead of using personal hardware to run them. Ultimately, Google has the ability to shut off your access to “your” games at any time, and there’s nothing you can do about it because they are stored in their cloud, not yours. There is currently no legal precedent to contest such cases, simply because this method of “ownership” is new and alien to our outdated property laws. 
  
  The problems within these laws are highlighted within another controversy in games as well - that of emulation and game preservation. Thousands of games on now-archaic systems are nigh impossible to experience without piracy, yet companies that have no intention of rereleasing these titles fight tooth and nail to defend their “intellectual property” -  property that, mind you, the original creators haven't seen a penny of in decades. 
  
  Though some of the topics I talk about here are different than those mentioned in the article, they struggle with the same issue - our intellectual property laws as they stand now do almost nothing to protect individual artists and are instead tailored to suit huge corporations. To preserve the flow of art, this needs to change. 

Article: Here be Dragons!

   Through our technologies of communications and media, people are able to experience parts of the world so far removed from their daily lives with incredible ease. However, this also removes a bit of the mystery for us - unlike those who lived in medieval and ancient times, we now know what exists (and what doesn’t) in most of our known world. 

   Thus, artists and scientists are seeing what limits they can push with biotechnology.
