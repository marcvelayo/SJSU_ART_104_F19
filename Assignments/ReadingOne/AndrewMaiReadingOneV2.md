Metamorphoses Digital Photography in the Electronic Age and Perfectm Digital Photography in the Bay Area 

Digital photography is a new medium in the field of photography that gives a whole new look and feel in photos. Specifically the amount of grain removed from digital photos that are present in film photography. With the increasing technology, digital manipulation in a new tool for artists to exercise their creativity. 

The popular photo manipulation program, Photoshop, has advanced to a point where photorealism and fake photos are becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate. A common example of this are removing people from a tourist location in broad daylight to give that illusion that you were the only person there or placing a person on top of a building that is restricted to the public. The most popular video that went viral of the power of photoshop is when a user transformed a pizza into a model.
	
Artists like Anil Melnick, Kathleen H. Ruiz, Eva Sutton, and Shelley J. Smith argue that digital manipulation conveys a direction of new truth into the photo and triggers a specific type of response to their viewers. An example of this concept would be Burson manipulating portraits of normal people and giving them birth defects to trigger a response of fear and a sense of reality to give the mind of her viewers as not all children are born perfect in our heads.

This is an interesting display of mixing mediums together to create a new digital media. Artist Liz Solo combines her theater arts practice into her digital space skills to create a hybrid virtual space and performance art. This is an interesting concept to see a person perform the art piece as well as having the audience be immersive into the surrounding of the digital space. It is an amazing feet for an artist to combine these works together and shows how much digital media is slowly transforming the art styles and displaying an evolution of new art.

I relate this to a lot of virtual reality as that is the direction technology is moving towards too. It is only in due time until artists capitalize this technology into their own creative hands. How I see Liz does this is by engaging with her audience and make them feel like they are part of her world as she describes, “an RPG world called Achaea”. Her next project called Second Life uses the same concept to explore the theme of birth. Through the use of bots and avatars, she performs and simulates the experience of giving birth in a virtual clinic. It is a beautiful display of acting and working with a virtual character that shows the relationship between the two.

What was really interesting for me was the use of gaming environments to use as a to relate to more people and spread awareness of political and social resistance. The use of World of Warcraft environment and actors within that space blends the idea we face in the real world masked by video games to demonstrate how real of a problem we have within our society. She further demonstrates power into her piece by playing in-game characters having conversations of peace and envisioning an environment of a peaceful world.
