	Technology and the environment are related because consumption of energy today is much different than the past. As we leave a bigger carbon footprint using more and more technologies such as bitcoin, the light that is emitted from the pollutants now enters the human eye and it changes our nature. The visual problems created by technology and the environment are not challenged and tells me a lot about the centralization of the internet. The controlled view keeps the users at the mercy of big companies. Peer to peer networks can question and create direct connection to people without damaging environment or neglecting individuals. These bias and male operated systems had bigger consequences when it came to the legal system. Since the records were corrupted from the beginning, the justice system was programmed to send people of color to jail more frequently. 
  
  Bad data is the result of human natural bias, another example that was given was Amazon’s system that hired men much more frequently than women due to an automation system that failed in equality. It is important to create systems that can create humanistic equality, rather than having to depend on a machine determine data based on corruption. Images became impartial to history, machines are making images that tell us how the world sees. When I look at an image now, I try to think of what it is trying to show me and how rather than what is actually shown. Looking for meta data in images to see any bias or prejudice through the images delivery is important because of bias. Understanding these invisible networks will help us understand our society not by what it shows but what it’s about.
